Zuglist Addon
=============

Installation
------------

1) Copy the contents of the check-out to $WOWDIR$/Interface/Addons/Zugslist/*
2) Sync via zugslist.com
3) Run WoW
4) Type in /wts [query] or /wtb [query] to search for an item

Development
-----------

1) The available variables are configured in Zugslist.toc.  Modify the per-char /
   global variable stores in that file.

   - Tradelinks collected by the addon are stored in the per-character files.
   - The WTS database is stored in the account-wide files

2) TradeParser.lua registers a bunch of event handlers.  Search for "register event\
   handlers" to find the list of channels that it modifies.

3) Zugslist.lua contains the user interface and handles searching for items.

   - Looks like Ace is used as the UI toolkit.
   - Zugslist:OnInitialize registers the console commands and sets up the databases
     ( scoping the database to the current realm and server)
   - OpenFrameFromConsole seems to be the entry point for /zugslist
   - Parse{WTB,WTS} is the entry point for /wtb, /wts
   - Apparently the WTS / WTB UIs are implemented as two tabs, but you have to use
     the button to switch between tabs.
   - The file format appears to be:
       'ZugslistData' => :realm => :faction => [:ports, :wtb, :wts, :wanted]
   - This part of the addon also monitors loots and spams you if you loot something
     that someone has offered to buy.

4) For the Upload file format, see the Rails repo: test/fixtures/addon_output.lua

5) Here's the data the server provides, which renders on the client:

ZugslistData = {
  ["Vashj"] = {
    ["Horde"] = {
      ["ports"] = { },
      ["wanted"] = { },
      ["wtb"] = {
      },
      ["wts"] = {
        {
          ["cols"] = {
            { ["value"] = "|cffffffff|Hitem:4240:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0|h[Woolen Bag]|h|r", },
            { ["value"] = "50g 30s 21", },
            { ["value"] = "Oriyaa", },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
